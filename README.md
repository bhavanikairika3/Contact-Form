```html
Creating a survey form with Fields; First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Country 
(dropdown), Gender (checkbox), Profession, email, and mobile number. All the input 
fields are necessary to submit the form. Create two buttons Submit and Reset. Reset will 
reset the form while clicking on submit, first, it will check all the fields and necessary 
validations and then a popup will appear displaying all the selected values with labels in 
front of it. On closing the popup, the form should reset all the values.

Let's Understand the coding part now :

<html lang="en">  =  This line declares the document type and specifies the language of the content as English.

<head>
    <!-- Meta tags and title -->
</head>  =  The head section typically contains meta tags and the title of the webpage, which are not provided in this specific code snippet.

<body onload="openPopup()">  =  This line specifies the body of the HTML document. The onload attribute calls the openPopup() function when the page finishes loading.

<div class="overlay" id="overlay"></div>  =  This line creates a div element with the class "overlay" and an ID "overlay". This div serves as a semi-transparent background covering the entire page when the pop-up is displayed.

<div class="popup-container" id="popup">  =  This line creates another div element with the class "popup-container" and an ID "popup". This div contains the survey form and other elements displayed as a pop-up on the webpage.

<span class="close-btn" onclick="closePopup()">X</span>  =  This line creates a span element with the class "close-btn" and sets an onclick attribute to call the closePopup() function when clicked. It displays an 'X' symbol to allow users to close the pop-up.

<h2>Survey Form</h2>  =  This line displays a heading inside the pop-up indicating that it's a survey form.

<label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="firstName">  =  These lines create a label and an input field for the user's first name. The for attribute in the label associates it with the input field for better accessibility.

<button type="button" class="submit-btn" onclick="submitForm()">Submit</button>
<button type="button" class="reset-btn" onclick="resetForm()">Reset</button>  =  These lines create buttons for submitting the form and resetting the form data. They are styled with classes "submit-btn" and "reset-btn" respectively. The onclick attributes call the submitForm() and resetForm() functions when the buttons are clicked.

<style>
    /* CSS styles for overlay, pop-up container, form elements, and buttons */
</style>  =  This section contains CSS styles to define the appearance of various elements on the webpage, including the overlay, pop-up container, form elements, and buttons.

ipt>
    // JavaScript functions for opening, closing, submitting, and resetting the form
</script> =  This section contains JavaScript code with functions that handle the pop-up behavior. These functions include openPopup(), closePopup(), submitForm(), resetForm(), and newResponse(). They control the visibility of the pop-up, handle form submission, and reset form data.
